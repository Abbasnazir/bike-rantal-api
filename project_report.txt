 Project Report: Bike Rental Prediction API
Project Summary:
This project builds a machine learning model to predict bike rental demand based on input features like weather, season, and working day. The final model (Random Forest Regressor) is deployed using a Flask API.

---

 Workflow Overview:

1. Data Cleaning:
- Loaded dataset
- Checked for missing values (none found)
- Selected relevant features

2. Model Training:
- Trained two models: Linear Regression and Random Forest
- Evaluated using MSE, RMSE, and R² Score
- Random Forest showed better performance

3. Model Saving:
- Saved the trained Random Forest model as bike_rental_model.pkl using Joblib

4. Flask API Development:
- Created a Flask API (app.py) with 2 routes:
  - / — Welcome route
  - /predict — Accepts POST requests with input JSON and returns predicted bike rental count

5. API Testing:
- Tested the /predict endpoint using Postman
- Confirmed working prediction response
